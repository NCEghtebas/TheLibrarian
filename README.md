# TheLibrarian
Heart Immersive Hack 


(Fresh Code Challenge) 
As we grow up and become more knowledgeable, we realize that there is so more to be explored and discovered. Google search was revolutionary and made lots of information available to us using new technology. We want to introduce a more natural and familiar way of exploring and finding answers to questions with our hands in a spatial environment without physical limitations. 

TheLibrarian is not just an immersive virtual library, its' interaction is a new form of search fueled by curiosity and is aimed at discovering new topics. A combination of gestures and keyboard inputs helps you navigate through the virtual space. Our dynamically generated book content takes you to articles on the web and has great potential when it is context aware. Our teams application, TheLibrarian, has the impact to provide an alternate search method for researchers, students, educators, and entrepreneurs who are searching for stimulating topics to generate ideas.
